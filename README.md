mail0wner is a small python script to get plaintext mail creds from a mail server on a network 
using [scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)

# Installation:

run the `install.sh` as root... so `sudo bash install.sh`
this will install `pip` through `easy_install`, then install the python package `scapy` through `pip`.


 Happy hunting ;)
